These examples use the craigslist api, which can be found [here](https://github.com/juliomalegria/python-craigslist).

It gives the average, max, and min.

title.

### Housing Example ###
Here we have an example that graph housing prices. It doesn't show up in github, so view it through nbviewer
[here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gregv21v/craigslist-examples/blob/master/Housing%20Example.ipynb).

### Housing sorted according to square footage ###
Here is some housing data sorted by square footage.

### Translation of Craigslist search into code ###
Since the craigslist api is a code translation of craigslist's search engine, I provided an example of that translation.

### Google Maps Example ###
This is for displaying maps with craigslist data overlayed, unfortunately maps are not showing up even if you view it in the nbviewer.
